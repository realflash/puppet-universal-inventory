Writing a package list
======================

Package lists are written in YAML. You can group OSes into package lists 
in any way you like. See notify_config.yml for an example.

Each package list is a series of rules indexed by package names, that 
you want to white list (not be notified about when they are installed
 on a machine). Each file starts with three dashes and then a list of 
 packages, like this:

---
  accountsservice:
  ack-grep:
  acl:
  
This will allow any version of a package called that to be ignored.
You can use a regex for the package name if you wish, by prepending it 
with REGEX~:

---
  accountsservice:
  ack-grep:
  acl:
  REGEX~linux-headers-[\w\d\.]+:

To specify that only a certain version of the package is OK, do this:

---
  accountsservice:
  ack-grep:
    installed_version: 6.7
  acl:

Or if multiple versions are OK:

---
  accountsservice:
  ack-grep:
    installed_version: 
      - 6.7
      - 6.8
  acl:

If a certain version is not OK, use an exclamation mark to ban it. 
Banned versions take precendence over allowed, so the moment a rule 
matches that bans the version processing moves on to the next package,
 even if the same version is listed as OK in the same list.

---
  accountsservice:
  ack-grep:
    installed_version: 
      - 6.7
      - 6.8
      - !6.9
  acl:

On Windows you can also specify that all the packages from a certain 
vendor are OK with the special package name ANY:

  ANY:
    vendor:
      - Microsoft Corporation
      - Intel Corporation
      - Broadcom Limited

Vendor information is not available on other OSs so you can create rules
 but they won't match.
